The build system uses the GNU autoconf and GNU automake tools.

You need to select at least one NAL when building the Portals library.

VPATH configures are also supported, so you can configure/build in
a directory other than the top of the source tree.  This allows you
to build multiple architectures simultaneously from a single source
tree.  See the GNU autoconf documentation for more information.

Use "./configure --help" to see the current configuration options.
