Except for very special cases (like portals3.h), DO NOT include
header files from other header files.  Instead, only include
header files from source (.c) files.  The reasons for this are:
  1) it eliminates the possibility of circular include problems
       (a.h includes b.h includes c.h includes a.h).
  2) it reduces the possiblity of needing to include half the
       world to get a single declaration.

The default coding style for this tree is that of the Linux kernel.
In particular, tabs are always 8 spaces.  Always.

See Documentation/CodingStyle from your favorite Linux kernel source
tree for details.

Note that there is code formatted in previous styles in this tree.
Nevertheless, follow the Linux kernel coding style.
