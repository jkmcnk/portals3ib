TCP NAL

We read these environment variables to tell us about our identity.

Required:
  PTL_IFACE  - String identifing interface, e.g. myri0, eth1, etc.

Optional:
  PTL_PID2PORT_FILE - Path to file containing pid -> IP port map for
	well-known (fixed) pids.  The file should contain lines with
	"<pid> <port>" on each line, for each well-known pid.  
	File name defaults to ./map_pid2port.
  PTL_DEF_PORTLIST - List of TCP ports, colon separated, to seach when
	connecting to a pid that is not in the list of well-known pids.

Entries for the default port list only need to be specified if the 
compiled-in values are insufficient/innappropriate for some reason.
If any default port values are specified via PTL_PID2PORT_FILE or
PTL_DEF_PORTLIST, the compiled-in default portlist is overridden.

In this implementation, the nid is the IPV4 address (in host byte
order) of the interface  (e.g. myri0, eth1, etc.) used to run portals.
We'll start up connections on demand, so we don't waste resources on
unused connections.
